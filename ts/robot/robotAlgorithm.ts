// Robot 'brain' to be composed with a robot to decide how to solve the maze. This is the abstract
// class. The specific subclasses will attempt to solve a maze in differing ways. 
// Note that the chooseDirection method is the main engine method which delegates as appropriate
// to the other direction choosing methods based on what openings are available in the cell in question
// Default implementations are provided for dead ends, straights and turns, but subclasses must make a 
// decision on how to handle junctions.
